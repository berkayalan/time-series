# Time Series Works

## Motivation

Time series is one of the special concepts in data science area. It is a specific way of analyzing a sequence of data points collected over an interval of time.
It shows how a data point or points can change over time. In other words, time is a crucial variable because it shows how the data adjusts over the course of the data points as well as the final results. It provides an additional source of information and a set order of dependencies between the data. 

 In my past experiences, I have seen that time series analysis or forecastion helps companies to understand main causes of trends or systemic patterns over time. Absolutely, the importance of it can change according to sector but it can be adapted to any sector as much as I see. 

 So, this makes this concept much important for all data scientists. I decided to focus to this area for a while and then created this repository. Mainly I will be focusing to Jose Portilla's **Python for Time Series Data Analysis** course but I will also try to dig into different resources that i will share in *Resources* section.
